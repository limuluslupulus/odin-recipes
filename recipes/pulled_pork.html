    <h1>Pulled Pork</h1>
    <img src="images/Pulled_pork.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Eastern-style barbecue is a whole-hog style of barbecue, often said to use "every part of the hog except the squeal". Eastern-style sauce is vinegar and pepper-based, with no tomato whatsoever. Eastern sauce is mostly used as a seasoning after the cook (although it can also be used as a mop sauce while the hog is cooking). The coleslaw served with eastern-style uses mayonnaise (or whipped salad dressing) almost universally.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 fresh pork butt, bone-in (this is the butt, or top portion, of the shoulder)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 cups apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons crushed red pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon chopped fresh garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Trim the excess fat from the pork butt.</li>
        <li>Slather the pork butt with yellow mustard, then apply a generous coating of rub.</li>
        <li>Wrap the pork butt in plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator overnight.</li>
        <li>Prepare the mopping sauce by combining all of the mop sauce ingredients in a lidded container. Shake to combine.</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, heat your smoker to 250 degrees. Smoke the pork butt until the bark is set. This typically occurs at roughly an internal temperature of 165-185 degrees, but will depend on the rub.</li>
        <li>Once the bark is set, begin mopping the pork butt with the mopping sauce each hour. Increase the mopping frequency to every 30 minutes once you reach 185 degrees.</li>
        <li>If using an instant read thermometer, remove the pork butt from the smoker when it is probe tender. If only using an indwelling meat thermometer this is typically between 203-205 degrees. The bone should pull out cleanly from the pork butt at this point. Total cook time is typically 8-10 hours but can vary greatly, so monitor the meat temp.</li>
        <li>Wrap the pork but in foil and rest for at least to hours in a cooler filled with towels, a Cambro, or an oven set to about 150-160 degrees.</li>
        <li>At the end of the rest, pull the pork apart with forks or with insulated gloves. Combine with any juices left in the foil.</li>
        <li>Serve with a side of the vinegar (mopping) sauce and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
